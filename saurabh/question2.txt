## Multiple remote repos

Usecase : 1. The application can go through various stages, so for each stage we can have remote repos, 
        to avoid conflits between stages.
        2. If we need to have Multiple server provider like aws and google cloud, and thus we can have to remote repos 
        for different provider


Steps:
1. Add Multiple remote repos 
    -> git remote add <remote-repo-name> <github-repo-url>

    Note: use different <remote-repo-name>
2. to push local commits to remote use
    ->git push -u <remote-repo-name> <branch-name>
